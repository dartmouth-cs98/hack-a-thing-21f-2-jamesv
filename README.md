# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

I followed an openCV tutorial. It started off with 9 chapters of learning OpenCV syntax. In each chapter, I manipulated images/videos/live camera content in some way. Then it finished with three mini projects. The first was similar to lab1 of CS10, where it paints colors over the web cam. The second was a document scanner that finds a document and then takes an upclose picture of it. The third was a number plate detector, which found the license plate on a car.

Include some screenshots.
I put screenshots in the seperate "screenshots" folder

## Who Did What?

I worked alone so I did the whole thing.

## What you learned

I learned a lot more about Computer Vision with Python. I learned how to better manipulate images and videos. In addition, I learned face detection and other cool skills. One annoying part of the tutorial was it is best suited to be used with an external camera, but I only had the one built into my laptop, which made it very difficult to test some of the projects. However, all of my code worked and it was a fun topic to explore!
